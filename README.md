# Strype [![CMake build](https://github.com/JackJackStudios/Strype/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JackJackStudios/Strype/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml)
[!IMPORTANT] 
    This project is nolonger actively maintained, please note stability is not guaranteed.

**Strype** is a modern, early-stage 2D game engine built for **pixel art**, **super-fast rendering**, and **rapid iteration**.  
Currently tested on **Windows x64** and **Ubuntu ARM64**.

## Features

- Super quick rendering optimized for pixel art
- Robust agnostic renderer (OpenGL - Vulkan comming soon!)
- Intergrates with C# (with .NET / MSBuild)
- Multi-threaded windowing with ImGui

## Using Strype

- Core & Runtime - **Windows or Linux**
- Editor - **Windows only** (DotNet/MSbuild)

To build the entire repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JackJackStudios/Strype
cd Strype
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j4
```

To create a simple app in Strype:

```cpp
#include <Strype.hpp>

using namespace Strype;

class TestSession : public Session
{
public:
    TestSession()
    {
        WindowProps.Title = "The Strype Engine";
        // Add other window props...
    }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    Application(argc, argv)
        .NewSession<TestSession>()
        .Run();
}
```

`Session`s are essentially containers for an OS window and Strype's `Renderer` class. Consider `Application` as a class responsible for the **Event System** and any global system required by other `Session`s. `Session`'s constructor is called on `Application::NewSession<Strype::Session>(Args&&...)` and should be used for configuration. All sessions are created and run exclusively on their own thread, if you want a startup function called on the actual thread use `Session::OnAttach()`.

## Roadmap

Strype’s goal is to create a developer and artist-friendly engine that integrates smoothly with professional tools, making game creation simpler compared to commercial engines.

### Main features to come:

- [x] 2D rendering expansion (text, video, particles)
- [x] Physics intergation and AABB collision
- [ ] More rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan)
- [ ] Integration with tools like [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), [FMOD](https://www.fmod.com/), and [Steamworks](https://partner.steamgames.com/)
- [ ] Flexbox-style UI system
- [ ] Templates and packages
- [ ] Hot reloading
- [ ] Animation system
- [ ] Proper audio support
- [ ] Export finished games
